# Deployed an AWS Public Module - VPC

Within this exercise, I learned all about AWS public modules including, how to...
- deploy public modules,
- manage dependencies and version requirements,
- read the Terraform Registry document, find and discover new public modules,
- understand the AWs public module file directory and structure.

### From commit: "deploy ec2 w/ ec2+vpc module"

From this execise, I...
- refactored my code from the last commit,
- learned how to reference output values from AWS Terraform modules,
- research the Terraform Registry document to find resources I need,
- combine multiple AWS Terraform modules to deploy an EC2 instance and VPC on AWS.
- destroy and clear all resoures deployed on AWS with `terraform destroy` OR `terraform destroy -auto-approve` command to prevent incurring unnecessary cost.
