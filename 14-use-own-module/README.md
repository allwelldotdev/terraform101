# Publish Own VPC Module to Terraform Registry, Pull, and use to Deploy VPC resource on AWS

Following the previous exercise into this one, I created a custom Terraform module for AWS VPC deployment.

In this exercise, I published my [own module to Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/allwelldotdev/vpc-own-module/aws/latest), pulled it, and used it (via test) to deploy VPC and subnet resource on AWS.
