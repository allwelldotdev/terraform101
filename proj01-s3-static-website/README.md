# Project 01: Create S3 Bucket on AWS & Deploy Static Website using Terraform IAC

I created an s3 bucket, added a 'random' provider to randomize s3 bucket key, set bucket to static wesbtie, provisioned website file contents, changed bucket public access permissions, and set bucket policy, using Terraform IAC.
